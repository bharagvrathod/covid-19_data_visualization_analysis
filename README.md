During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers surveyed participants around the
globe. A baseline study was conducted with the aim of identifying the most important predictors of
pro-social COVID-19 behaviours, that is, actions that would reduce the spread of the virus. You can
read a more detailed description of the research and results in Van Lissa (2022), see references.
The aim of this project is to understand country-level differences in predictors of pro-social
behaviours, reported by participants as: “I am willing to:
• help others who suffer from coronavirus.” (c19ProSo01)
• make donations to help others that suffer from coronavirus.” (c19ProSo02)
• protect vulnerable groups from coronavirus even at my own expense.” (c19ProSo03)
• make personal sacrifices to prevent the spread of coronavirus.” (c19ProSo04)
It is to analyse the baseline survey data overall, with a focus on the assigned country Pakistan, answering the following questions

## 1. Descriptive analysis and pre-processing.
(a) Describe the data overall, including things such as dimension, data types, distribution of
numerical attributes, variety of non-numerical (text) attributes, missing values, and anything
else of interest or relevance.
(b) Comment on any pre-processing or data manipulation required for the following analysis.

## 2. Focus country vs all other countries as a group. 
(a) Identify your focus country from the accompanying list (FocusCountryByID.pdf). How do
participant responses for your focus country differ from the other countries in the survey as
a group?
(b) How well do participant responses (attributes) predict pro-social attitudes
(c19ProSo01,2,3 and 4) for your focus country? Which attributes seem to be the
best predictors? Explain your reasoning.
(c) Repeat Question 2(b) for the other countries as a group. Which attributes are the
strongest predictors? How do these attributes compare to those of your focus country?

## 3. Focus country vs cluster of similar countries. 
(a) Using several social, economic, health, political or other indicators, identify between 3
and 7 countries (in the baseline data) that are similar to your focus country using clustering.
Van Lissa (2022) refers to several indicators you might consider, among others. Some of
these are listed in the references, but these are not exhaustive. State the indicators used and
describe how you calculated/identified similar countries. Copy and paste the table of values
you used for your clustering into your report as an Appendix.
(b) How well do participant responses predict pro-social attitudes (c19ProSo01,2,3
and 4) for this cluster of similar countries? Which attributes are the strongest predictors?
How do these attributes compare to those of your focus country? Comment on the similarity
and/or difference between your results for this question and Question 2(c). That is, does the
group of all other countries 2(c), or the cluster of similar countries 3(b) give a better match
to the important attributes for predicting pro-social attitudes in your focus country? Discuss.
